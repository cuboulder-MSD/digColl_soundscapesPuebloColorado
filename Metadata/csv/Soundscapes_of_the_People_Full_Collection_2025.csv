Additional topics include: Al Cozzetto; Cesar Chavez Academy; Mariachi San Luis; Pueblo Pride City Marching Band; Rocky DiNero; trumpet; violin; ""Amor de los dos""; Mexican American families; elementary school music; folklórico dance; mariachi music. 00:13:54 David Benavidez Jr. mentions that they have a few of their members that started out when they were instructing in the folklórico group.

This is how Angel got involved with performing mariachi. Additional topics include: Mariachi Reyna De Los Angeles; Mariachi Spectacular; Albuquerque, NM; mariachi music; folklórico dance. 00:17:44 Kahla (David's wife and Phoenix's mother) introduces herself and talks about how she got involved with playing mariachi music. David recalls that the primary motivation was financial, to have another family member involved as a touring musician. Additional topics include: vihuela; gig economy; mariachi music; touring musicians; folklórico dance. 00:21:29 Chávez states, “I have a question and I want to open this up to my colleagues as well. You said in a really beautiful way of ‘putting the instrument in their hands…’"" David speaks about the importance of music education in various levels in the formation of his musical knowledge, from his instrument instructors to listening to professionals at conferences. Jerry, who grew up in a rural background, remembers how his father had to make his own mariachi instruments in order to start his ensemble. Both discuss the primary educators that influenced their musical journeys and allowed for them to become educators themselves. Additional topics include: Al Eberhardt; Albuquerque, NM; CU Boulder; Francisco (Chino) Rodriguez; Frank Vigil; Mariachi Tenampa; San Luis Valley; guitarrón; Rocky DiNero; instrument making; mariachi music; music education. 00:28:56 Interviewer, Susan Thomas, asks, “If I could just ask, you've mentioned your father a couple of times and that he founded the Mariachi San Luis. What's his first name?” Jerry and David recount the history and regionality of mariachi music in Colorado. The working areas of mariachi groups that emerged in Denver in the 1980s do not cross over much with groups in southern Colorado, the San Luis Valley, and Pueblo.

Additional topics include: Albuquerque, NM; Las Cruces, NM; Mariachi Institute of Chicago; Tucson, AZ; Mariachi Spectacular; music conferences. 00:34:10 Malin states, “I was curious to hear a little more from the dancers how much you feel like the dancing helps you in learning to play music.” Kahla discusses how her background in folklórico dance helps with learning mariachi rhythms. David then discusses collaborating with local dancers. Additional topics include: Del Rio, TX; Grupo Folklorico Omawari; Iskra Merino; mitote; sones; mariachi music; folklórico dance. 00:36:24 Thomas states, “So, you said that when you decided, ‘hey we're going to start a mariachi,’ there's both an artistic reason and a business reason to do this, you said that there really weren't mariachi here in Pueblo at the time?” David discusses the process for turning his mariachi playing into a gigging business. He had several failed endeavors before learning how to make it work. He and Jerry finally formed Mariachi Diamante in 2019. Additional topics include: Manual Andrade; Mariachi Perla Tropical; boleros; mariachi trio; trumpet; Tres Margaritas Restaurant; gig economy; mariachi music. 00:43:15 Chávez asks the group to elaborate on the terms ""working mariachi"" and ""show mariachis."" David discusses the difference between ""working"" and ""show"" mariachi ensembles. Show mariachis are larger and play their own presentational set list. Working ensembles play songs by audience request and work at more varied venues and private events, such as birthdays and quinceañeras. Jerry adds that the music of show mariachis is more refined, while working mariachis are often made up of amateur musicians or those with a different day job.

Additional topics include: Mariachi los Camperos; trajes de charro; Mariachi Vargas De Tecalitlán; gig economy; live music; mariachi music. 00:52:17 Chávez states, “I want to follow up on a theme that just came up and it's actually a part of our questions when we talk about thinking about cultural resiliences. How does this musical practice relate to your ethnic and social background?” Jerry talks about how his musical practice links himself to his family's past and ancestry. Rafa adds that he just enjoys playing mariachi music. David stresses the importance of keeping his cultural traditions alive for the next generation and for his daughter Phoenix, as he was raised by family members who experienced the suppression of Mexican culture in the United States. Kahla likewise reminisces about how her father made efforts to ensure that his daughters learned about their Mexican heritage, even though he himself was not taught how to speak Spanish. Participating in folklórico dance opened her eyes to the range of cultural experiences of different Mexican Americans. Angel's family members also participated in folklórico dance. Phoenix adds that she enjoys singing and being in the next generation of performers. The interviewees also discuss their family roots in southern Colorado and New Mexico. Additional topics include: ""Huerfano""; ""Las Mañanitas""; Antonio Aguilar; Fiesta Days; Mariachi Aztlan; Mariachi Reynas De Los Angeles; folklórico dance; Chicano culture; Mexican American families; cultural preservation. 01:07:07 Thomas states, “So I'm wondering, as a group that came up in the last decade and part of a landscape of music in Pueblo right now in a city that has been going through a lot of changes…” David talks about Pueblo's ""learning path"" of gradually coming to appreciate and put value in the arts. Jerry, however, contests that the city's music scene has always been vibrant, but agrees that younger generations should be educated to be better connected to the musical past of the city. Additional topics include: Carlos Crull; Colorado State Fair; Four Tops; Kenny Gonzalez; Linda Ronstadt; The Four Seasons; The Klamm Shell; Tower of Power; Antonio Aguilar; Pueblo--community life; Pueblo--live music. 01:13:56 Malin asks the group what brought them here from the San Luis Valley.

Additional topics include: Anthony Vigil; CSU Pueblo; Cesar Chavez Academy; music education. 01:15:33 Chávez asks, “I have a question for you, and then also the group. Stylistically, when you were singing ‘Volver, Volver’ you have some adornos…” Jerry discusses how he developed his own personal singing style and unique ornamentation by listening to mariachi masters while also staying within his own musical abilities. Even the group's musicians have developed their own unique musical style, based on David's and the group's interpretation of previous recordings of the songs. Additional topics include: Antonio Aguilar; Javier Solís; Miguel Aceves Mejía; Vicente Fernández; polka; ""Volver, Volver""; Mexican songs; mariachi music. 01:20:05  Chávez asks “...what would you like to say for people to know about who you are about as individuals from Pueblo, but also about mariachi music in Pueblo?” The interviewees give their final remarks about sustaining the tradition of mariachi playing in Pueblo. Jerry stresses that mariachi music is inclusive and emotionally-fulfilling. Kahla shares the important family connection that she has made through her participation with Mariachi Diamante. Additional topics include: Antonio Aguilar; Mariachi Cobre; Mariachi Diamante; Mariachi Reyna De Los Angeles; Vicente Fernández; mariachi music.

Additional topics include: Temple Emanuel; Mineral Palace Park; neighborhoods--Pueblo, CO; Jewish history--Colorado. 00:42:56 Malin asks, “And how has this congregation changed, like since the '80s, '90s?” David laments the diminishing UHC congregation.

She discusses her childhood in Arkansas and her family's relocation to Pueblo for her father's work. Her father eventually became a pastor and she began her musical activity in church at a young age. She eventually went on to train other local gospel singers, such as Kennedy Pugh. Additionally, she discusses the history of Pueblo black community, racial tensions in Pueblo during her youth, and the changing scene of gospel music at Pueblo's black churches. She also gives a demonstration of the gospel song ""I Know I've Been Changed.""","00:00:00 JoAn Gilmore-Jackson and the interviewers introduce themselves and the Pueblo Soundscapes project. JoAn recounts her history with Kennedy Pugh, one of her vocal students who is a well-known local artist. JoAn grew up in Dumas, Arkansas before her family moved to Pueblo for her father's work. Although most of her siblings have moved to California, she stayed in Pueblo, where she worked primarily in nursing and was active in gospel singing. Additional topics include: ""Star Spangled Banner""; ""the home of heroes""; American Music Research Center; Bethlehem Baptist Church; CF&I Steel Mill; California; Dumas, AR; Kennedy Pugh; Pueblo Depot Activity; gospel music; nursing; National Endowment for the Humanities; Baptist--religious music; immigration--Colorado; African American history--Colorado. 00:10:58 JoAn mentions she had been singing in Pueblo for fifty years! JoAn describes the gospel scene in Pueblo. She says that while gospel was booming in the city in the '70s and '80s, it went into decline in the '90s due to dwindling church attendance. A few black churches in the city still have small gospel choirs. Though she thinks the black churches of the city should consolidate their congregations, she says there are too many differing opinions for this to be possible. Additional topics include: Bethlehem Baptist Church; Eighth Street Missionary Baptist Church; Kentucky; New Bethany Church; New Hope Church; Oregon; St. Louis, MO; Washington; St. Paul, MN; Baptist churches; Methodist churches; gospel music. 00:16:25 Interviewer, Susan Thomas, asks, “Is there a particular style of gospel that is popular, especially like in those missionary baptist churches?” JoAn describes the gospel style in Pueblo as being primarily focused on choir-based singing without accompaniment. Eventually JoAn started playing piano accompaniment at about the age of ten. She briefly studied piano with a local nightclub musician, Venus Lewis, but stopped because the teacher made her cry. Instead, she and her sister would sneak off to McDonald's. Later, she describes how local church singers who went into solo singing careers like her all sung in the gospel style. Additional topics include: ""Chopsticks""; Blend, CO; McDonald's; Ponderosa Restaurant; Pueblo County Country Club; Rudel Smith; Star Bar; Venus Lewis; collared greens; piano; gospel choirs; piano lessons; gospel music. 00:27:45 Thomas asks if there was a real division between people who played out and people who played in church. There was a community divide between those who sang in church and those who sang professionally. This was evidenced by the ousting of a singer who included the phrase ""oo baby"" into a performance at a church where her father was the pastor, causing uproar in the community. Additional topics include: Floyd Carter; Martin Luther King Jr.; Salt & Pepper; New Hope Baptist Church;church singing; gospel music. 00:30:00 JoAn talks about some of the family legacies in church leadership and attendance among the black churches in Pueblo. In her own family, none of her children have continued her singing, though her son is an online church minister. Additional topics include: ""Wade in the Water""; ""gift of Gab""; Anthony Woodfork; Bethlehem Baptist Church; Martin Luther King Jr.; Spirit of the Shepherd Ministries; tithe; New Hope Baptist Church; gospel music; African American churches--Colorado. 00:35:43 Interviewer, Austin Okigbo, states, “It seems from everything you're saying there was a very vibrant black community here.” From the 1960s to the early '80s, Pueblo had a vibrant black community, drawn by the city's various industries. The community drastically declined in the '80s when the steel mill closed, causing a big exodus to California. Her children's' generation mostly left to Denver for economic opportunities in the '90s. JoAn surmises that the city's black community has decreased from about 15,000 people in the 1970s to about 10,000 today, though much of today's black population are new military transplants. JoAn bemoans the loss of a united community feeling at church today, as opposed to the past when there was a large amount of community choir involvement. Additional topics include: California; Colorado State Hospital; Denver, CO; Pueblo Union Depot; CF&I Steel Mill; African American history--Colorado. 00:44:31 JoAn discusses the dwindling community-based culture in Pueblo. She sees this as a reflection of a dwindling religiosity in the city, starting in the 1990s. She uses the decline in caring for the homeless population of the city as an example of people caring less for their community and the general public. Additional topics include: 60 Minutes; Central Christian Church; City of Pueblo; covid-19 pandemic; homelessness; community life--Pueblo, CO.  00:52:46 JoAn discusses growing up in Pueblo during the Chicano and Black Panther movements. He father met with civil rights leaders to discuss peaceful versus violent protesting and she participated in protests. She discusses that the white baptist church population was sympathetic to the civil rights movement and also participated in protests, likely due to the more-liberal leanings in Pueblo, as opposed to, for example, Colorado Springs. Additional topics include: Black Panthers; Cesar Chavez; Chicano Movement; Colorado Springs, CO; Democrat; Emmanuel Church; H Rap Brown; Lake Avenue Church; Pueblo Army Depot; Republican; folk singing; Centennial High School;social protest--Baptist church; social protest--Pueblo, CO; civil rights movement. 01:00:11 JoAn discusses the connections between southern Colorado's religious life and the state's military bases. Connections with military churches allowed for greater performance opportunities for JoAn's church singing. JoAn surmises that the current presence of military personnel in Pueblo is tied to the poor housing situation in Colorado Springs, where the bases are located. Additional topics include: Colorado Springs, CO; Fort Carson, CO; Fountain, CO; military churches; urban renewal; James H. McMearn;religion--military; United States Armed Forces.  01:06:19 JoAn lives in the Hyde Park subdivision in Pueblo's ""West Side."" She discusses the boundaries of Pueblo's neighborhoods. The South Side neighborhood was the upper class area of the city, which did not allow for black residents during JoAn's childhood. However, Pueblo's schools were not segregated in the 1960s. Additional topics include: ""Dogpatch"" neighborhood; Aberdeen subdivision; Pueblo East Side neighborhood; Pueblo North Side neighborhood; Pueblo South Side neighborhood; Pueblo West Side neighborhood; Hyde Park subdivision;racial segregation--Pueblo, CO; redlining; neighborhoods--Pueblo, CO. 01:10:13 Okigbo asks, “So there's some degree of overlap between the black civil rights movement and the Chicano movement? How did those two interface or interact?” Though there was overlap between the black civil rights and Chicano movements in Pueblo, there was a lot of youth fighting due to racial tension between the black and Mexican communities. JoAn was even the cause of a race-based riot in high school, though she was chastised by her father. She believed the divide between the black and Mexican communities of Pueblo exists to this day. Additional topics include: Black Panthers; Brown Berets; Centennial High School; Chicano movement; black supremacy; civil rights movement; racism; racial segregation--Pueblo, CO. 01:15:52 Thomas asks, “Was there a Buddhist temple here when you were growing up?” JoAn discusses the divide between religious denominations in Pueblo when she was growing up. The black community was primarily Baptist and though they sometimes interacted with Methodist and Jewish children, they tended to shun Seventh Day Adventists, as they worshiped on Saturdays. She bemoans the division that this old way of thinking caused. Additional topics include: Judaism; Methodist Church; Seventh Day Adventist Church; Missionary Baptist Church; religion--Pueblo, CO; denominations--Christianity. 01:18:15 JoAn criticized the way that standards for church attire have declined for some younger church members. Dr. Okigbo, as a Catholic priest, discusses his own experience of these declining standards. Dr. Thomas includes that it is at least positive that they are showing up to church, though JoAn disagrees. Currently, JoAn still sings and plays piano at church and substitutes at the Cornerstone Church in Fountain, CO. Additional topics include: Catholic Mass; gospel music; church attire--religion. 01:24:21 JoAn doesn't like the inclusion of modern praise music in church, instead preferring purely gospel music. She gives a demonstration of ""I Know I've Been Changed"" to show a traditional gospel style of church singing. She believes that the older traditions of gospel singing are superior to the more modern style with its ""worldly"" additions. Additional topics include: Kirk Franklin; Thomas Dorsey; black church music; ""I Know I've Been Changed""; gospel music. 01:36:04 --- Thomas asks, “Among the black churches here in town, especially those Missionary Baptist churches, did any of them have bands as part of the service or was it just keyboard?” Black churches in Pueblo used a variety of instruments in their church services. Additional topics include: Hammond organ; guitar; horns; keyboards; organ; piano; tambourine; saxophone; church music. 01:36:58 JoAn warns against mixing the ""worldly"" with the sacred as this invites the Devil in. She bemoans the erosion of religious tradition in the United States. Additional topics include: Satan; religious beliefs. 01:39:44 JoAn's father would implore his children to sing gospel songs in 5-part harmony. She surmises that pastors having their children sing could be a Southern cultural tradition, while Dr. Okigbo includes that it could come from an older African tradition of children singing to their elders. JoAn discusses how the tradition of gospel is taught to the next generation, such as with her instruction of Kennedy Pugh. The tradition of teaching gospel singing is closely intertwined with teaching religious gospel. She led workshops in gospel singing from the 1960's to the '90s. Additional topics include: Kennedy Pugh; church picnics; church retreats; workshop; ""Amazing Grace""; Afro-diasporic traditions; gospel music; music education; religious education; church singing. 01:50:03 Thomas asks, “Do you feel like there's a uniquely Colorado or Southern Colorado sound?” JoAn surmises that the gospel style of Pueblo is more traditional than that heard in Colorado Springs, which has a more modernized style. She supposes that her style is also distinctive from that heard in the out of state places she has performed as well, such as Texas and Missouri, though she includes that her style could be influenced by her early childhood in Arkansas. Additional topics include: Arkansas; Missouri; Texas; Colorado Springs, CO; gospel singing. 01:53:05 JoAn says that hearing traditional gospel should give you ""something to think about."" Her goal in life is to praise God through her gospel singing. She concludes with a discussion of her gospel music collection. The interviewers explain to her how her collection might be digitized. Additional topics include: James Cleveland; Mississippi Mass Choir; Shirley Caesar; The Caravans; YouTube; eternal life; music technology; gospel music.

He talks about his conversion to Judaism, his role at Temple Emanuel, and Jewish life in Pueblo.","00:00:00 Michael Pacheco and the interviewers introduce themselves.

I guess you've been in the area for your whole life, and how did you get involved with the Jewish community here?” Michael came to Pueblo for college and stayed in the city afterward. He first got involved with the Jewish community in 2017 when he began attending services at Temple Emanuel. He describes the process of conversion to Judaism as a long a gradual process. He was helped along the way by members of the Temple Emanuel community including the now-retired Rabbi Birdie Becker, who would drive from Denver each week. Additional topics include: Helen Atlas-Acuna; Mike Atlas-Acuna; Temple Emanuel; Rabbi Birdie Becker; Judaism--Colorado; conversion to Judaism. 00:09:19 Michael began chanting Torah at Temple Emanuel after the covid lockdown.

Additional topics include:  Hadar Institute; Jewish Theological Seminary; Skype; Zoom; covid; Jewish chant. 00:11:17 Malin asks, “And so, tell us a bit more about your role now in the services, in the music of the services?” Michael leads Friday night services at Temple Emanuel with another person, Jon Kirschman. The congregation fluctuates between about 7-15 people, though they experienced an uptick of attendance after the Oct. 7th incident in Israel. The congregation includes both Jewish and non-Jewish people. About five members are recent converts to Judaism. Additional topics include: October 7th Attack; United Hebrew Center; Jon Kirschman; Judaism--Colorado. 00:14:36 Interviewer, Rebecca Wartell, asks, “I'm curious about that, even in your own family and your conversion. How did your family respond? Were they supportive of your conversion and do you see that as a broader trend in this area?” Michael's family was supportive of his conversion to Judaism. Although he can't say it reflects a broader trend, he does notice a steady rate of locals converting every couple of years. 00:15:29 Malin states, “So, it's always an interesting issue in Judaism, right, with how much you're using musical instruments in services.” Michael uses a guitar in services at Temple Emanuel, but not at the United Hebrew Center. However, he does play klezmer with other community members for festive holidays, like Hanukkah. He describes the musical style he uses at Temple Emanuel as ""Reform Camp Song,"" a style of Jewish religious music that became part of the Reform Jewish liturgy about thirty years ago. UHC's music is a bit more traditional. Both congregations sing in both Hebrew and English. Additional topics include: Hadar Institute; Hanukkah; Reform Judaism; United Hebrew Center; a cappella; accordion; keyboard; klezmer; percussion; guitar; Judaism--Colorado; Jewish music. 00:17:32 Michael enjoys learning languages and so did not have trouble learning to pronounce Hebrew.

Do you feel like that's helped you in this position here?” Michael regularly incorporates skills he learned in classroom planning and management to leading services. Additional topics include: Torah; elementary education. 00:21:32 Since 2017, community members have passed and others have had other big milestones, such as bat and bar mitzvahs. Michael describes a general trend toward population decline after the closing of the CF&I Steel Mill, which caused many families to move to other parts of the state. Additional topics include: CF&I Steel Mill; Denver; bat mitzvah; bar mitzvah; Judaism--Colorado. 00:24:12 Malin asks, “So you mentioned some kids having bar and bat mitzvahs here. Were you involved in teaching them?” Temple Emanuel's Sunday School was more active before covid. Michael would help teach in the Sunday School. After covid there has been less activity. Additional topics include: bat mitzvah; covid; bar mitzvah; covid pandemic; Judaism--Colorado. 00:25:06 Wartell asks, “Since Rabbi Birdie retired, is there like a visiting rabbi or a student rabbi that comes to the congregation or is it all sort of community led?” Both Temple Emanuel and the UHC are layperson-led, except for the High Holy Days when a rabbi flies in from out of town to lead services. Besides collaborating with the UHC, Temple Emanuel has collaborated with Temple Montefiore in Las Vegas, New Mexico and Temple Aaron in Trinidad, Colorado. Additional topics include:  Las Vegas, NM; October 7th Attack; Rabbi Birdie; Rabbi Jeffery Feinstein; Temple Aaron; Temple Emanuel; Temple Montefiore; Trinidad, CO; United Hebrew Center; High Holy Days; Judaism--Colorado. 00:27:09 Malin asks if there are venues outside of the synagogue.

Additional topics include: Hanukkah; Louie Borochaner; Temple Emanuel; United Hebrew Center; klezmer; Jewish holidays; Jewish music. 00:30:28 Michael discusses how music is often a person's entry point into Jewish traditions.

He describes some of the different musical atmospheres between the Reform services at Temple Emanuel and the Conservative/Orthodox services at the United Hebrew Center. Additional topics include: Orthodox Judaism; Temple Emanuel; Torah; United Hebrew Center; minyan; trope; Reform Judaism; Jewish cantillation; spirituality--music; Jewish music. 00:40:52 Michael plays 2nd violin with the Pueblo Symphony.

Additional topics include: Liberty Point Elementary School; Pueblo West Side neighborhood; dreidel; Orff Schulwerk;  Jewish holidays; elementary education; music education. 00:46:19 Interviewer, Susan Thomas, states, “And you mentioned you studied here at CSU Pueblo.

Additional topics include:  Daniel Brandt; Veronika Afanassieva; Veronika String Quartet; violin; CSU Pueblo; music education. 00:47:06 Michael talks about community outreach that has been done following the October 7th attack in Israel. The community has tried to reach out and educate the public instead of becoming more isolated. Additional topics include: October 7th Attack; Judaism--Colorado. 00:49:03 Thomas asks,  “In talking with elders from the community, do people ever talk about what services were like decades ago and maybe what the music in the services was like?” Michael describes archival research done about Temple Emanuel's past, including finding old prayer books. The temple has an organ, which was likely used in services during the early 20th century. He also talks about the legacy of Rabbi Raich, who worked at the CF&I Steel Mill. Additional topics include: CF&I Steel Mill; Rabbi Raich; Yeshiva University; organ;  Jewish music; Judaism--Colorado. 00:53:10 The co-leader at Temple Emanuel, Jon Kirschman, lives in Colorado Springs and is connected to the military.

Additional topics include: Colorado Springs; David Israel; High Holy Days; United Hebrew Center; guitar; Jon Kirschman; Judaism--Colorado; Jewish cantillation. 00:54:58 Wartell asks, “Can I ask one more question? Again kind of a broader question, earlier you said that you had done some sort of outreach and Jewish educational programming and I'm just wondering about your experience…” The community experienced a bomb threat in the past and have seen anti-Semitic flyers in downtown Pueblo. However, they have not experienced any increased anti-Semitism since the October 7th attack in Israel. They hire security for their larger community events. Additional topics include: October 7th Attack; anti-Semitism; racial discrimination--Pueblo, CO.
